# Dependencies command

Upload dependencies graph to Datadog to detect runtime vulnerabilities by Continuous Profiler.

## Usage

### Setup

You need to have `DATADOG_API_KEY` and `DATADOG_APP_KEY` set in your environment.

```bash
export DATADOG_API_KEY="<API KEY>"
export DATADOG_APP_KEY="<APP KEY>"
```

By default, the command sends requests to Datadog US. To use Datadog EU, set `DATADOG_SITE` environment variable to `datadoghq.eu`.

### Commands

#### `upload`

This command uploads dependencies graph to Datadog to detect runtime vulnerabilities by Continuous Profiler.

To upload the dependencies graph generated by the [snyk cli](https://github.com/snyk/snyk#cli), run: 

```bash
snyk test --print-deps --sub-project=<PROJECT_NAME> --json > ./snyk_deps.json
datadog-ci dependencies upload ./snyk_deps.json --source snyk --service <SERVICE_NAME> --release-version <SERVICE_VERSION>
```

* The first positional argument is the path to file that contains dependency graph. 
The file should be generated by the `snyk test --print-deps --sub-project=<YOUR_PROJECT> --json` command.

* `--source` (required): set to `snyk` as currently it's the only integration we support.

* `--service` (required): name of the service (should match the `service` tag).

* `--release-version`: version of the service (should match the `version` tag). Provide it to prevent analysis from using 
  out of date dependencies.

In addition, some optional parameters are available:

* `--dry-run` (default: `false`): run the command without the final step of upload.
